Followed this guide to implement the basic MERN application: 
https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-a-login-auth-app-with-mern-stack-part-1-c405048e3669

Going to follow this blogpost: https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2019/11/18/react-nodejs-on-aws-how-to-deploy-a-mern-stack-app-to-amazon-ec2
(aka this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FanoTGjkxhQ&ab_channel=JasonWatmore) to deploy the app on an AWS server.

It seems however that this guide assumes that you have the front end and backend as 2 separate running applications,
which is perfect as this is what I wanted... A separation of concerns with respect to the front and back end. So I am
going to have to split up the front and backend before following this guide I guess.
